Social platform with the aim of connecting tutors and students in Myanmar

## Problem
Education in Myanmar has always been a top priority among students and parents of all types of demographics. Private supplemental tutoring especailly in Myanmar is a very booming and traditional part of Myanmar's education sector with more than 85% of all students recieving tutoring outside of school. In a [research](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/in/documentViewer.xhtml?v=2.1.196&id=p::usmarcdef_0000373594&file=/in/rest/annotationSVC/DownloadWatermarkedAttachment/attach_import_6879a23d-e20b-46f3-b997-2e5628bb87ba%3F_%3D373594eng.pdf&locale=en&multi=true&ark=/ark:/48223/pf0000373594/PDF/373594eng.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A39%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C55%2C838%2C0%5D) conducted by the Comparative Education Research Center of UNESCO on shadow education in Myanmar, it found despite private tutoring's implications, in societies like Myanmar, this was a system that was not going to leave. So drawing upon the positives of promoting learning and providing incomes for tutors, there is still a wide potential for the education sector to utilize and modernize the way this tutoring ecosystem works. There is a humongous market for tutors and students/parents often find themselves moving from tutor to tutor trying different recommendations and such often not finding or achieving the results that they want. Also tutors unable to compete in the market only usually have the path of word of mouth to advertise and market themselves. There are great tuition centers that are have the means and ability to advertise and market themselves but often even these great tuition centers are known to many that may need them.
